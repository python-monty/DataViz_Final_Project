Version 6 of final draft

Shows two viz's presenting cyber attack data from 2014 to
2023

Left Viz shows the number of attacks against various
industries over time.

Right Viz shows the types of attacks executed by various
actors against a selected industry (from the left viz).

Updates from version 5

-Added highlighting of hovered data in color legend as well
as line plots. -Added custom cool scheme to handle twenty
different datapoints. Previous version had repeating colors.

Future work: -possibly change right viz to a weighted
circles to show when multiple same datapoints exist. -fix
brushing in right viz to highligh actors when selecting over
multiple attack types.
