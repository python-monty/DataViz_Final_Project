# Data Visualization Project

## Data

-The data I propose to visualize for my project is a Cyber Security Attack dataset from the University of Maryland's CISSM Cyber Attacks Database.
-This dataset provides information related to the tactics of know Cyber actors, against organizations catagorized by industry type from Jan 1 2014 to Dec 29 2023. 
-An example of one data entry with the following attributes (though some maybe be null):
    "evtDate": "2023-12-29",
    "actor": "Avos Locker",
    "actor_type": "Criminal",
    "organization": "Stratford University",
    "industry_code": 61,
    "industry": "Educational Services",
    "motive": "Financial",
    "event_type": "Mixed",
    "event_subtype": "Data Attack",
    "description": "Stratford University, discloses a ransomware attack, probably by the Avos Locker gang.",
    "source_url": "https://www.databreaches.net/stratford-university-discloses-ransomware-attack-but-which-ransomware-attack/",
    "country": "United States of America",
    "actor_country": "Undetermined",
    "year": null,
    "num_attacks": null

-The dataset is made available for download through Russ McRee's paper Internet Storm Center: Exploratory Data Analysis with CISSM Cyber Attacks Database - Part 1

-The data can be loaded in csv format directly from the project's github repo

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What types of industries are targeted most across time?
 * What attackers are most active across time?
 * Is there any correlation between the types of industry and the attacker?
 * What types of attacks are used by actors against their targets?

## Sketches
This sketch shows 3 different visualizations that display different data depending on the selections made in each. 

Viz 1 : A line graph showing the number of attacks in each year by Industry Code.
Viz 2 : A scatter plot showing the Actor attacks across time, each cirle representing and industry code (type).
Viz 3 : A Bar graph showing the count of each attack type carried out by an actor.

Selecting a line (representing an Industry Code) in the line graph will highlight all the attack events against that industry type in Viz 2.
Selecting a circle (representing an Actor) in the scatter plot will display all the attacks carried out by that actor over time, by count of attack in the Viz 3 bar graph. 


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a few proof of concept visualizations of this data. 

The first is a line graph showing the number of attacks in each year by Industry Code (type).

The second is a scatter plot showing the Actor attacks across time, each cirle representing and industry code (type).

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.
You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

Since there are so many Industries as well as Actors...I'm not sure how I can represent all the datapoints in a clear manner.
I'm not sure how to use the actions in one viz to change data in another at this point. 

## Milestones
week 9 - Complete design concept
week 10 - Clean up bugs in existing Line and Scatter plot
week 11 - Link Line graph to scatter plot
week 12 - Begin creating the bar graph
week 13 - Complete the bar graph
week 14 - Link the scatter plot to the bar graph
week 15 - Add any new functionality if possible
week 16 - Fix bugs/Finish/Present Project
